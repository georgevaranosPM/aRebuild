This thesis was carried out to answer a question that arises in many visitors of archaeological sites when they observe a damaged monument: "How was this monument before its destruction and how was it used?" The answer to this question is analyzed throughout this work, explaining which tools could be used to develop an Augmented Reality application that could apply all over the world, inside and outside archaeological sites. After carrying out research on the validity of the historical data and the current technologies, a novel Android mobile application is proposed, in which each user is guided and can enjoy the visual result provided by Augmented Reality technology. The current version of the application is provided for the Archaeological Site of Dion and specifically for the Temple of Goddess Demeter. So, through this conjunction of Technology with History, the understanding of historical facts and monuments will become easier and more enjoyable than ever.
